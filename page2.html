<h1 class="s1" > The history of Swimming</h1>

<h1 class="s1">


There is some evidence that shows swimming started as early as 2500 BCE in Egypt.  In the early days, ancient Egyptians were said to have swam in the river nile for fun. After this other countries started to follow and learn to swim.  On the other hand, the Romans and Greeks used swimming to train their soldiers. 


Now 80% of people in the world can swim!
